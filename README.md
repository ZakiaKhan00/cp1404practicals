# CP1404 Practicals 

## About This Repository
Welcome to my CP1404 Practicals Repository. My name is **Zakia Adilah Khan**.  
This repository documents my learning journey through the **CP1404 Programming II** subject at **James Cook University**.  

Each practical explores a core programming concept, including:
- File handling and exceptions  
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets)  
- Version control using GitHub  
- Peer code reviews  

All exercises were developed using **PyCharm** as the development environment.  

These exercises reflect my commitment to writing clean, reusable code, applying iterative improvements, and producing readable documentation. Together, they demonstrate the essential skills required for success in CP1404 and lay the foundation for future software development work.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- Use meaningful variable and function names to improve readability.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Avoid duplication by reusing code and applying DRY principles.
