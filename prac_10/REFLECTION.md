# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were sometimes unrealistic at the start, often underestimating the time required for debugging and testing.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I became better at estimating how long tasks would take, particularly when reviewing feedback or conducting peer reviews, because having done them before made the process quicker.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?


I learnt to pay closer attention to how long tasks actually take, and that my focus can greatly influence my productivity, I either work very efficiently or get distracted easily.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I realized the value of feedback from others, as they can notice mistakes or suggest improvements that I might have overseen.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I learned how to critically analyze code for clarity, efficiency, and correctness. Reviewing others’ code also helped me notice patterns and techniques I could apply in my own work.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[PR #1 for Practical 5 — CP1404 Practicals](https://github.com/zeze347/cp1404practicals/pull/1#event-20543621702)

### Explanation

I was very thorough in this review, carefully checking each file and line of code. I provided detailed feedback on potential improvements, suggested better practices where applicable, and ensured my comments were constructive and clear. My approach aimed to help the developer improve their code while maintaining a positive and supportive tone.

### Good Code Review 2

[PR #2 for Practical 6 — CP1404 Practicals](https://github.com/yaner-233/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-20665763329)

### Explanation

In this review, I provided clear and constructive feedback, highlighting areas for improvement while also noting good practices. I asked questions to encourage discussion and made actionable suggestions without being overly critical.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include more exercises for API code to give students additional hands-on experience before assignment. This comment is quite niche, as it specifically applies to master’s students who need these resources for A3, which bachelor’s students do not complete.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I quickly learned Git and version control, which was new to me, and it was a really valuable learning experience being introduced to GitHub.
