# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve started practising codes while watching lecture videos and documenting small codings. Lindsay was right, it does help understand the concepts better and makes it easier to refer back when completing practical exercises.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

This trimester will end in less than 4 weeks and I’m still trying to allocate specific time slots for my weekly workload to stay consistent. I keep telling myself I’ll start assignments earlier, but, guess what?, I still haven’t looked at Assignment 3.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been keeping up or should I say I was keeping up with all the lecture videos, which really helped me stay on track. However, I’ve fallen behind since Week 5, so I need to catch up soon—otherwise, the backlog will make it harder to understand so many concepts at once. My plan is to prioritise catching up this weekend to get back on track. Fingers-crossed!!

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

PROCRASTINATION!! There’s so much to do and so little time, and even though I plan ahead, I still struggle to keep up with everything. I can’t simultaneously work on multiple assignments at the same time. Like do a little today, continue tomorrow. And this drags the tasks until the deadlines are near.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I think if IT courses could include more real-world examples showing how these coding concepts are applied in actual projects, and more concrete examples would make the learning more meaningful. All I know right now is that what I’m learning will be used somewhere, but I don’t know where or how.
